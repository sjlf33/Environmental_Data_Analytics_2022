## Set up your session 
1. Set up your session. Check your working directory. Load the tidyverse, agricolae and other needed packages. Import the *raw* NTL-LTER raw data file for chemistry/physics (`NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv`). Set date columns to date objects.

2. Build a ggplot theme and set it as your default theme.

```{r setup}
#1 
#getwd() 
library(agricolae)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate) 
library(dplyr) 

Lakes <- read.csv("../Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, header = TRUE) 

Lakes$sampledate <- as.Date(Lakes$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y") 


#2 
mytheme <-theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black")) 
        #legend.position = "top") 
theme_set(mytheme)

```

## Simple regression
Our first research question is: Does mean lake temperature recorded during July change with depth across all lakes?

3. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this question:
> Answer:
H0: Mean lake temperature recorded during July does not change with depth across all lakes.
Ha: Mean lake temperature recorded during July does change with depth across all lakes.


4.  Wrangle your NTL-LTER dataset with a pipe function so that the records meet the following criteria: 
 * Only dates in July. 
 * Only the columns: `lakename`, `year4`, `daynum`, `depth`, `temperature_C`
 * Only complete cases (i.e., remove NAs)

5. Visualize the relationship among the two continuous variables with a scatter plot of temperature by depth. Add a smoothed line showing the linear model, and limit temperature values from 0 to 35 °C. Make this plot look pretty and easy to read.

```{r scatterplot}
#4 
JulyLakes <- Lakes %>%  
  mutate(month = month(sampledate))%>%
  filter(month== "7")%>% 
  select(lakename, year4, daynum, depth, temperature_C)%>% 
  filter(!is.na(temperature_C)) 
  
#5  
JulyLakes.PLOT <- ggplot(JulyLakes, aes(x = depth, y = temperature_C, color = depth))+
  geom_point()+ 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "pink")+ 
  xlim(0,18)+
  ylim(0,35)+ 
  xlab(expression(paste("Depth  ", "(m)")))+ 
  ylab(expression(paste("Temperature  " , degree,"C"))) 
  #scale_color_brewer(direction = -1)
print(JulyLakes.PLOT)   

#switch axis- from luana
# how to properly relabel legends?
# scale_y_continous
# labs(fill ="legend title")
# scale_fill_manual(legend_title, values="new title")

```


6. Interpret the figure. What does it suggest with regards to the response of temperature to depth? Do the distribution of points suggest about anything about the linearity of this trend?

> Answer: As depth (m) increases, temperature decreases, signifying that colder temperatures are in the deeper parts of the lakes in July. Near lakes' surfaces, we can observe that temperatures are higher (warmer).The distribution of the points suggest that it is not linear, but still positively correlated. 


7. Perform a linear regression to test the relationship and display the results

```{r linear.regression}
#7
JulyLakes.regression <- lm(data = JulyLakes, temperature_C ~ depth)
summary(JulyLakes.regression)  
# do i take the log? because its not linear? yes to log of one variable. 
# Luana says the log isn't required for this assignment but recommends it.

# we want a high r-squared (.95)
# p- values show the sigificance of the regression,  
# we want a small p-value! 
# if the r squared is 0, you should add more variables 
# to choose new variables, you can test first for correlation between variables OR look at interaction factor -- (sometimes you have explanatory variables that are already highly correlated)
# so instead of calculating metrics in pairs, we use the correlation matrix 
# the second method is the step wise algorithm. Running as many variables as you have on your data frame. this checks the combination of variables in your linear regression. 
# stepwise looks at the AIC 

```


8. Interpret your model results in words. Include how much of the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth, the degrees of freedom on which this finding is based, and the statistical significance of the result. Also mention how much temperature is predicted to change for every 1m change in depth. 

> Answer: For every 1m increase in depth, temperature decreases by 1.95 degrees Celsius.The r-squared shows that 73.87% of the variability in changes in temperature is explained by changes in depth. The degrees of freedom are 9726.The statistical significance shows a very low p-value.

## Multiple regression
Let's tackle a similar question from a different approach. Here, we want to explore what might the best set of predictors for lake temperature in July across the monitoring period at the North Temperate Lakes LTER. 


9. Run an AIC to determine what set of explanatory variables (year4, daynum, depth) is best suited to predict temperature.

10. Run a multiple regression on the recommended set of variables. 

```{r temperature.model}
#9  
JulyAIC <- lm(data = JulyLakes, temperature_C ~ depth + year4 + daynum)
summary(JulyAIC)

step(JulyAIC)  
# all 3 variables are higher than my start AIC (26065) 
# so I will include variables: depth, year4, and daynum
NewJulymodel <- lm(data = JulyLakes, temperature_C ~ depth + year4 + daynum)
summary(NewJulymodel)  

Julymodel2 <- lm(data = JulyLakes, temperature_C ~ depth + daynum)
summary(Julymodel2) 
 
AIC(Julymodel2, NewJulymodel)  
# lower AIC with all variables

#10  
JulyMULT.REGRESS <- lm(data = subset(JulyLakes), temperature_C ~ depth + year4 + daynum)
summary(JulyMULT.REGRESS) 

# every time you add a explanatory variable you lose a degree of freedom. 

```

11. What is the final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests we use to predict temperature in our multiple regression? How much of the observed variance does this model explain? Is this an improvement over the model using only depth as the explanatory variable?

> Answer:The final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests we use to predict temperature in our multiple regression are depth, year4, and daynum.
The model explains 74.11% of the observed variance.  
This is a slight improvement over the model using only depth as the explanatory variable.

## Analysis of Variance

12. Now we want to see whether the different lakes have, on average, different temperatures in the month of July. Run an ANOVA test to complete this analysis. (No need to test assumptions of normality or similar variances.) Create two sets of models: one expressed as an ANOVA models and another expressed as a linear model (as done in our lessons).

```{r anova.model}
#12  

# ANOVA model  
summary(JulyLakes$lakename)

July.Lakes.anova <- aov(data = JulyLakes, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(July.Lakes.anova)

# Linear model 
# Format ANOVA as lm 
July.Lakes.anova_lm <- lm(data = JulyLakes, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(July.Lakes.anova_lm)

```

13. Is there a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes? Report your findings. 

> Answer: All lakes have a p-value below 0.05. we reject the null hypothesis, signifying that average temperatures of the lakes are all different. However, Crampton Lake is less significant than East Long Lake, Hummingbird Lake, Paul Lake, Peter Lake, Tuesday Lake, Ward Lake, and West Long Lake (all of these lakes except Crampton Lake have same levels of significance).Despite this Crampton being less significant, it is still below reocommend p-value,therefore we still reject the null hypothesis.


14. Create a graph that depicts temperature by depth, with a separate color for each lake. Add a geom_smooth (method = "lm", se = FALSE) for each lake. Make your points 50 % transparent. Adjust your y axis limits to go from 0 to 35 degrees. Clean up your graph to make it pretty. 

```{r scatterplot.2}
#14. 
FinalGraph <- 
  ggplot(JulyLakes, aes(y = temperature_C, x = depth, color = lakename))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5)+ 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)+
  xlim(0,18)+ 
  ylim(0,35)+ 
  xlab(expression(paste("Depth  ", "(m)")))+ 
  ylab(expression(paste("Temperature  " , degree,"C")))
print(FinalGraph)

```

15. Use the Tukey's HSD test to determine which lakes have different means.

```{r tukey.test}
#15 

TukeyHSD(July.Lakes.anova)
LakesMeans <- HSD.test(July.Lakes.anova, "lakename", group = TRUE) 
LakesMeans

```

16.From the findings above, which lakes have the same mean temperature, statistically speaking, as Peter Lake? Does any lake have a mean temperature that is statistically distinct from all the other lakes?

>Answer:The lakes that have the same mean temperature (statsitically speaking) as Peter Lake are Paul Lake and Ward Lake. There are no lakes with mean temperatures statistically distinct from all the other lakes. 


17. If we were just looking at Peter Lake and Paul Lake. What's another test we might explore to see whether they have distinct mean temperatures? 

>Answer: Another test to explore whether Peter Lake and Paul Lake have distinct mean temperatures is a t.test.
